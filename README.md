# Application of SIR Epidemic Model in Network Information Dissemination
This is the final project of the course MATH-UA 251 Math Modeling. 

### Model:
We intend to apply the modified SIR model to estimate the trend of the spread of online information since the spread has strong similarities with the original scenarios that the SIR model used. 

In the SIR model:
S represents the number of susceptible individuals, which is similar to people who have the potential to know the information and may read the information. 
I represent the number of infected individuals, which is similar to the people who read the information. 
R represents the number of recovered individuals, which is similar to people who have already read the information. 

Since the spread of online information has similar properties to the spread of infectious diseases, we suppose it’s possible to model the spread of online information through the SIR model. The estimation of the spread is generally a regression problem, so we probably will use metrics like MSE or RMSE to evaluate the results.

### Scenario Assumption:
The Internet has become an indispensable part of our lives, serving as a vibrant hub for the dissemination of information—a phenomenon that has garnered significant scholarly attention. Currently, a substantial portion of research into the dissemination of network information leans heavily on network theory.

Researchers employ cybernetics theory alongside tools like Ucinet and blockchain to analyze and predict online information flows. However, these methodologies face challenges when addressing the intricacies of large-scale networks and the multifaceted nature of factors like emotional responses. The exploration extends to sophisticated methods such as convolutional neural networks and random forests, which, despite their precision, offer limited clarity on their internal processes. Moreover, the SIR model, a concept borrowed from epidemiology, provides valuable insights into information spread by drawing parallels with disease transmission.

The spread of information through networks is marked by three distinct traits: the reliance on computer networks as conduits, the fleeting nature of user interest, and the propensity for information that resonates or 'heats up' to disseminate more swiftly. These traits mirror the transmission dynamics observed in infectious diseases, where contact facilitates spread, and interest wanes over time, diminishing the chances of re-engagement.

We propose adapting the SIR model to better understand online information spread, integrating the impact of content popularity to enhance its accuracy in depicting this phenomenon. We aim to fine-tune the model to improve its relevance and efficacy in the context of network information spread, intending to validate the adjusted model through empirical testing with specific data sets. This endeavour seeks to advance our comprehension of the nuanced dynamics governing the spread of information on the Internet.
