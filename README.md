# Application-of-SIR-epidemic-model-in-network-information-dissemination
This is the final project of course MATH-UA 251 Math Modeling. The project aims to apply the modified SIR model to estimate the trend of the spread of online information since the spread has strong similarities with the original scenarios that the SIR model used.
